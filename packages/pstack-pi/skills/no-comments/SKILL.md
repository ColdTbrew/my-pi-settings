## Pi runtime adapter

This is a Pi adaptation of a Codex workflow. These runtime rules take precedence over Codex-specific mechanics below.

- Resolve bundled references and scripts relative to this skill directory. The package root is two directories above this SKILL.md.
- Invoke bundled skills with `/skill:<name>`, or read the sibling skill's SKILL.md when this explicitly invoked workflow routes to it. Do not apply pstack automatically outside an explicit invocation.
- Pi does not ship Codex's spawn/send/wait/close-agent tools, custom-agent TOML runtime, task APIs, plan tool, goals, or scheduled automations. Use only tools actually exposed in this session. Never invent a tool or silently launch Codex as a substitute.
- Read `../poteto-mode/references/model-routing.md` before delegation. Without a compatible agent extension, perform ordinary exploration, implementation, and verification sequentially in the current session. Keep bounded roles and acceptance criteria, but label self-review as self-review. Independent or multi-model review remains an unfulfilled gate; report the gap rather than claiming arena/interrogate coverage or shipping through it.
- Keep multi-step plans in a local Markdown file or the conversation when no plan tool exists. Do not claim persistent monitoring, scheduled runs, goal creation, or work after this turn without an actual supported runtime.
- Use Pi history under `~/.pi/agent/sessions` for Pi recall and handoff. Search Codex history or memory only when the user explicitly asks to import Codex context. Do not edit `~/.codex/agents` from a Pi setup workflow.
- Codex built-in/plugin labels below are provenance, not integrations available in Pi. Use the bundled sibling skill if present. If a referenced external skill or connector is absent, report it and retain the acceptance criteria. Browser tasks use an available browser skill/tool; do not assume browser or terminal-control APIs exist.
- The user's current provider, model, and thinking level remain unchanged. Available tools, user instructions, and the host safety rules govern external actions and destructive operations.

# No comments

Spawn Comment Sicko. Act on accepted findings.

Defer to Comment Sicko's fresh perspective.

## Scope

Use the caller's files or diff. Otherwise use the current diff against the base branch, default `main`, including the working tree.

## Steps

1. Spawn the read-only `comment_sicko` custom agent. Pass the scope. Do not restate its rules.
2. Inspect its report and diff. Reject application-code edits, scope escapes, exception-protected deletions, misstated `MUST KILL` reasons, and flags that treat kept intentional code as guilty. Reshape flags on our-code surprises stay actionable. Do not restore those comments. A keep survives only with proof it is about something we cannot change. Audit missed scoped lint and TypeScript suppressions. Correctness or safety suppressions stay actionable `MUST KILL`s. Restore deletions only with exact exceptions and scoped proof. Before accepting thin `IMPORTANT` or `do not remove` kills or keeps, run `/skill:how` or `/skill:why` on their symbol. If a kill is ambiguous, do not restore. If a keep is refuted or still ambiguous, delete it. Revert and rerun one rejected report with the failure named. Reject a second, report it open, and fail `/skill:no-comments`.
3. Fix trivial accepted flags directly by deleting a dead path, dropping a parameter, or using the real API. If any fix needs a shape, run `/skill:architect` once for the accepted set and surrounding code. Stop at the sketch. Architect shapes. Step 4 implements.
4. Implement the smallest root-cause fix in scope. Remove every named workaround. If the root cause is out of scope, land the smallest in-scope fix and report the rest open. The **principle-fix-root-causes** and **principle-redesign-from-first-principles** skills guide intent only. Neither authorizes widening the fence nor fixing instances outside it. Never bolt on symptom guards.
5. Constraint comments say `do not remove`, `do not change wording`, or `talk to X before changing`. Leave keeps about things we cannot change. Offer the cheapest in-scope type, runtime, test, or CI lint. Wait for interactive approval. Unattended and eval require caller pre-approval. If approved, encode then delete. Otherwise delete, report the constraint open, and sketch out-of-scope work.
6. Report the deletion count, restored comments, reruns, architect sketch, fixes, encoding offers, encodings, unenforced constraints, and other open work.
