## Pi runtime adapter

This is a Pi adaptation of a Codex workflow. These runtime rules take precedence over Codex-specific mechanics below.

- Resolve bundled references and scripts relative to this skill directory. The package root is two directories above this SKILL.md.
- Invoke bundled skills with `/skill:<name>`, or read the sibling skill's SKILL.md when this explicitly invoked workflow routes to it. Do not apply pstack automatically outside an explicit invocation.
- Pi does not ship Codex's spawn/send/wait/close-agent tools, custom-agent TOML runtime, task APIs, plan tool, goals, or scheduled automations. Use only tools actually exposed in this session. Never invent a tool or silently launch Codex as a substitute.
- Read `../poteto-mode/references/model-routing.md` before delegation. Without a compatible agent extension, perform ordinary exploration, implementation, and verification sequentially in the current session. Keep bounded roles and acceptance criteria, but label self-review as self-review. Independent or multi-model review remains an unfulfilled gate; report the gap rather than claiming arena/interrogate coverage or shipping through it.
- Keep multi-step plans in a local Markdown file or the conversation when no plan tool exists. Do not claim persistent monitoring, scheduled runs, goal creation, or work after this turn without an actual supported runtime.
- Use Pi history under `~/.pi/agent/sessions` for Pi recall and handoff. Search Codex history or memory only when the user explicitly asks to import Codex context. Do not edit `~/.codex/agents` from a Pi setup workflow.
- Codex built-in/plugin labels below are provenance, not integrations available in Pi. Use the bundled sibling skill if present. If a referenced external skill or connector is absent, report it and retain the acceptance criteria. Browser tasks use an available browser skill/tool; do not assume browser or terminal-control APIs exist.
- The user's current provider, model, and thinking level remain unchanged. Available tools, user instructions, and the host safety rules govern external actions and destructive operations.

# Interrogate

Spawn the three Codex reviewer profiles to adversarially review code changes. Each gets the same prompt and rubric. Profile and model diversity creates independent blind spots; agreement is higher-confidence signal, while lone findings still deserve inspection.

The deliverable is a synthesized verdict. Do NOT auto-apply changes.

## Step 1, Determine Scope

Identify what to review from context:

- If the user points at specific files or a diff, use that
- If on a feature branch, run `git diff main...HEAD` (or the appropriate base branch) for the full changeset
- If the user's message references recent work, gather the relevant files

Package the diff (or file contents) plus any surrounding context files the reviewers need to understand the code.

## Step 2, State the Intent

Before spawning reviewers, state the intent explicitly. Derive this from:

- The user's message
- Commit messages
- PR description if one exists
- The code itself

Write one clear paragraph. If you're unsure about the intent, ask the user before proceeding.

## Step 3, Spawn Reviewers

Select the ordinary or high-risk reviewer set from [model routing](../poteto-mode/references/model-routing.md). Launch independent reviewers concurrently within the active session limit, including the root and all descendants; use waves when needed.

If a profile is unavailable, proceed with the remaining reviewers and report the dropout. Run `/skill:setup-pstack` separately to repair or change a profile; do not silently invent a model slug during the review.

Read `references/reviewer-prompt.md` and fill in the template with:
1. The stated intent
2. The diff or file contents
3. The review rubric from `references/rubric.md`
4. The code-quality lens from `references/code-quality-review.md`

The same filled template goes to all reviewers, so every model applies the code-quality lens.

## Step 4, Synthesize

As results come back, build a unified picture:

1. **Parse all findings** from the reviewers
2. **Identify consensus**. Findings raised by 2+ models independently are highest signal.
3. **Identify lone-model findings**. Still worth reading, but weight accordingly.
4. **Deduplicate**. Different models may describe the same issue differently. Merge these and note which models raised it.
5. **Note disagreements**. If one model flags something and another explicitly says the opposite, that's useful context for the verdict.

## Step 5, Lead Judgment

You are the lead reviewer, a pragmatic senior engineer, not a neutral aggregator.

Read `references/lead-judgment.md` for the full framework.

Categorize every finding using these buckets:

- **Act on**. Real issues affecting correctness, security, or maintainability given the actual goals. These would block a real PR.
- **Consider**. Legitimate points, but you're not sure they outweigh the cost of addressing them right now. Worth the user's attention.
- **Noted**. Technically valid but not actionable. Context-dependent, premature optimization, or low-impact given the current stage.
- **Dismissed**. Wrong, nitpicky, or missing context. Brief explanation why.

For each finding, include:
- Which model(s) raised it
- The category (act on / consider / noted / dismissed)
- A one-line rationale for the categorization

## Output Format

Present the verdict in this structure:

### Intent
> [The stated intent paragraph from Step 2]

### Reviewers
- Reviewer [label]: [model name], [N findings] (one bullet per reviewer)

### Act On
[Findings that should be addressed. For each: description, which models raised it, why it matters.]

### Consider
[Findings worth thinking about. For each: description, which models raised it, tradeoff involved.]

### Noted
[Valid but low-priority. Brief list.]

### Dismissed
[Rejected findings with brief rationale.]

### Agreement Map
[Where did models agree, where did they diverge, and what does the pattern of agreement/disagreement tell us?]
