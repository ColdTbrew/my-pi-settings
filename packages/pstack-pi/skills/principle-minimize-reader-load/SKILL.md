## Pi runtime adapter

This is a Pi adaptation of a Codex workflow. These runtime rules take precedence over Codex-specific mechanics below.

- Resolve bundled references and scripts relative to this skill directory. The package root is two directories above this SKILL.md.
- Invoke bundled skills with `/skill:<name>`, or read the sibling skill's SKILL.md when this explicitly invoked workflow routes to it. Do not apply pstack automatically outside an explicit invocation.
- Pi does not ship Codex's spawn/send/wait/close-agent tools, custom-agent TOML runtime, task APIs, plan tool, goals, or scheduled automations. Use only tools actually exposed in this session. Never invent a tool or silently launch Codex as a substitute.
- Read `../poteto-mode/references/model-routing.md` before delegation. Without a compatible agent extension, perform ordinary exploration, implementation, and verification sequentially in the current session. Keep bounded roles and acceptance criteria, but label self-review as self-review. Independent or multi-model review remains an unfulfilled gate; report the gap rather than claiming arena/interrogate coverage or shipping through it.
- Keep multi-step plans in a local Markdown file or the conversation when no plan tool exists. Do not claim persistent monitoring, scheduled runs, goal creation, or work after this turn without an actual supported runtime.
- Use Pi history under `~/.pi/agent/sessions` for Pi recall and handoff. Search Codex history or memory only when the user explicitly asks to import Codex context. Do not edit `~/.codex/agents` from a Pi setup workflow.
- Codex built-in/plugin labels below are provenance, not integrations available in Pi. Use the bundled sibling skill if present. If a referenced external skill or connector is absent, report it and retain the acceptance criteria. Browser tasks use an available browser skill/tool; do not assume browser or terminal-control APIs exist.
- The user's current provider, model, and thinking level remain unchanged. Available tools, user instructions, and the host safety rules govern external actions and destructive operations.

# Minimize Reader Load

Maintainability is the work a reader must do to understand code. Track two axes:
1. **Layers to trace.** How many indirections sit between the question and the answer.
2. **State to hold.** How much hidden or mutable context the reader must keep in their head.

**Why:** Code is read far more than it is written. LOC, cyclomatic complexity, and "clean architecture" are proxies. Reader load is the thing that matters. The two axes are independent. A flat file with 50 globals can be as hard to reason about as a 6-layer adapter stack. Guard both. This is the human analog of [Guard the Context Window](../principle-guard-the-context-window/SKILL.md). Working memory is finite for readers too.

**The pattern:**
- **Collapse layers** that cost more than they save: wrappers with one caller, adapters with no second implementation, speculative indirection that was never needed. Inline them.
- **Make adjacent layers change the abstraction.** A layer that repeats the same methods and arguments adds reader load without compression. Collapse pass-through layers.
- **Demand interface compression.** A broad interface that hides little complexity makes readers learn both the surface and the implementation. Prefer boundaries that hide meaningful decisions.
- **Shrink state scope:** prefer pure functions (returns over mutations), locals over fields, fields over module state, and module state over globals. Derive instead of sync.
- **Name the invariant at the boundary,** not in every consumer, so the reader learns it once.
- Before adding a layer or a piece of state, ask: does this reduce reader load somewhere else by at least as much?

**The test:** Can a new reader answer "where does X come from?" and "what can change X?" in under 30 seconds? If not, cut layers or cut state.
