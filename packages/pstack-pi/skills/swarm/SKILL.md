## Pi runtime adapter

This is a Pi adaptation of a Codex workflow. These runtime rules take precedence over Codex-specific mechanics below.

- Resolve bundled references and scripts relative to this skill directory. The package root is two directories above this SKILL.md.
- Invoke bundled skills with `/skill:<name>`, or read the sibling skill's SKILL.md when this explicitly invoked workflow routes to it. Do not apply pstack automatically outside an explicit invocation.
- Pi does not ship Codex's spawn/send/wait/close-agent tools, custom-agent TOML runtime, task APIs, plan tool, goals, or scheduled automations. Use only tools actually exposed in this session. Never invent a tool or silently launch Codex as a substitute.
- Read `../poteto-mode/references/model-routing.md` before delegation. Without a compatible agent extension, perform ordinary exploration, implementation, and verification sequentially in the current session. Keep bounded roles and acceptance criteria, but label self-review as self-review. Independent or multi-model review remains an unfulfilled gate; report the gap rather than claiming arena/interrogate coverage or shipping through it.
- Keep multi-step plans in a local Markdown file or the conversation when no plan tool exists. Do not claim persistent monitoring, scheduled runs, goal creation, or work after this turn without an actual supported runtime.
- Use Pi history under `~/.pi/agent/sessions` for Pi recall and handoff. Search Codex history or memory only when the user explicitly asks to import Codex context. Do not edit `~/.codex/agents` from a Pi setup workflow.
- Codex built-in/plugin labels below are provenance, not integrations available in Pi. Use the bundled sibling skill if present. If a referenced external skill or connector is absent, report it and retain the acceptance criteria. Browser tasks use an available browser skill/tool; do not assume browser or terminal-control APIs exist.
- The user's current provider, model, and thinking level remain unchanged. Available tools, user instructions, and the host safety rules govern external actions and destructive operations.

# Swarm

Fan out N Codex workers. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent drains them, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Create or update a Codex plan with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. Run larger swarms in waves that fit the active Codex concurrency limit.
4. Select each slice using [model routing](../poteto-mode/references/model-routing.md): retain Luna for bounded coverage and escalate implementation slices by difficulty. For a model race, name the builder profile assigned to each arm.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. When workers verify or measure commits, each brief names the exact SHAs. A measurement brief also names the method (sample count, what one sample is, order). The worker records both in its result.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn every wave concurrently with the profiles selected in Frame. All local Codex agents share the workspace and permission boundary, so every writing brief must state exclusive files, branch, or worktree ownership.

When a worker must start from a non-default branch, name that base branch explicitly.

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence. A worker that can prove a defect reports `ISSUES` and lists every issue it can prove, not only the first.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. Drop a result that does not record the SHAs and method its brief names, and respawn that worker once. After a second miss, record a gap. A gap does not count as a pass. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
