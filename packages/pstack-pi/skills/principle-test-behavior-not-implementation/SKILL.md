## Pi runtime adapter

This is a Pi adaptation of a Codex workflow. These runtime rules take precedence over Codex-specific mechanics below.

- Resolve bundled references and scripts relative to this skill directory. The package root is two directories above this SKILL.md.
- Invoke bundled skills with `/skill:<name>`, or read the sibling skill's SKILL.md when this explicitly invoked workflow routes to it. Do not apply pstack automatically outside an explicit invocation.
- Pi does not ship Codex's spawn/send/wait/close-agent tools, custom-agent TOML runtime, task APIs, plan tool, goals, or scheduled automations. Use only tools actually exposed in this session. Never invent a tool or silently launch Codex as a substitute.
- Read `../poteto-mode/references/model-routing.md` before delegation. Without a compatible agent extension, perform ordinary exploration, implementation, and verification sequentially in the current session. Keep bounded roles and acceptance criteria, but label self-review as self-review. Independent or multi-model review remains an unfulfilled gate; report the gap rather than claiming arena/interrogate coverage or shipping through it.
- Keep multi-step plans in a local Markdown file or the conversation when no plan tool exists. Do not claim persistent monitoring, scheduled runs, goal creation, or work after this turn without an actual supported runtime.
- Use Pi history under `~/.pi/agent/sessions` for Pi recall and handoff. Search Codex history or memory only when the user explicitly asks to import Codex context. Do not edit `~/.codex/agents` from a Pi setup workflow.
- Codex built-in/plugin labels below are provenance, not integrations available in Pi. Use the bundled sibling skill if present. If a referenced external skill or connector is absent, report it and retain the acceptance criteria. Browser tasks use an available browser skill/tool; do not assume browser or terminal-control APIs exist.
- The user's current provider, model, and thinking level remain unchanged. Available tools, user instructions, and the host safety rules govern external actions and destructive operations.

# Test Behavior, Not Implementation

A test calls the code the way its users do and asserts the result they observe against a literal expected value. A test that asserts which calls the code made, or restates a constant the code contains, does neither.

The check: before you keep a test, ask whether it would still pass if every function it imports returned `undefined`. If yes, it observes no behavior and cannot fail for a defect. Rewrite the assertion or delete the test.

**Why:** A test that cannot fail for a defect costs CI time and review attention and catches nothing. A constant pin also fails when someone edits the constant or the prompt it restates, so it prevents that edit.

**Five shapes that still pass when every imported function returns `undefined`:**

- **Weak or no assertion.** No `expect`, or only `toBeDefined`, `toBeTruthy`, `not.toThrow`, `toBeInstanceOf`, `toBeGreaterThan(0)`.
- **Mock or absence only.** Only `toHaveBeenCalled`, `not.toHaveBeenCalled`, `toBeUndefined`, `toEqual([])`, `toHaveLength(0)`, `not.toBe(wrongValue)`.
- **Self-referential.** The expected value comes from the code under test: `expect(f(a)).toBe(f(a))`, `expect(parsed.url).toBe(buildUrl(...))`.
- **Constant pin.** The assertion restates a hand-maintained constant, config default, table row, or prompt string: `expect(LIMITS.maxTools).toBe(8)`, `expect(PROMPT).toContain("You are")`.
- **Fixture asserts fixture.** The assertion reads data the test built or a value computed in `beforeEach`, and the subject never runs inside the body.

**The fix:** call the subject inside the test body with one concrete input and assert the literal output or the observable effect, `expect(slugify("Hello, World!")).toBe("hello-world")`. For an absence, assert the presence on the other input in the same test. For a constant, test the mechanism that reads it with one input instead of restating the value. For a mock, assert the payload it received or the state after the call, not that it was called. When no such assertion exists, delete the test.

**Keep** a test of a relation across a table's rows (a key present in two tables, a parent that exists), and a compile-time check in a `*.test-d.ts` file.
